Assemble files & suggestions re: the WHO Vx Cvg Cluster Survey Reference Manual

We will gather files here related to the finalized version of this manual:

1. Word document(s)
2. Image files
3. Stata or other programs that make and label figures (possibly with labels in different languages)
4. Datasets required to run those Stata programs
5. Zotero or EndNote library with bibliography info
6. Others...

And we will use the 'Issues' tab of this repository to enter and track suggested changes to the manual.
